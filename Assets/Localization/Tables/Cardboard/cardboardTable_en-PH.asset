    m_Localized: "Cardboard is a thick and stiff paperboard or paper-based material
      that is commonly used for packaging, construction, and other purposes. Layers
      of paper or pulp are pressed and cemented together to form a strong and long-lasting
      substance.\r\nCardboard is valued for its adaptability, as it can be easily
      cut, folded, and shaped to suit various needs. It is a low-cost alternative
      for packaging goods, protecting items in transit, and constructing temporary
      or permanent buildings in construction or design projects.\r"
