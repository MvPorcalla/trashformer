    m_Localized: Glass is a solid substance with a smooth, shining surface that is
      often transparent and fragile. It is commonly used to make windows, containers,
      and other objects with a smooth, shiny surface. It's made by cooling a molten
      combination of several materials to a hard state without crystallization. Because
      of its transparency, smoothness, and adaptability, it is a valuable material
      in a variety of sectors.
