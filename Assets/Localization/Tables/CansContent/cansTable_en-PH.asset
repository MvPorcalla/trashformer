    m_Localized: "Cans are metal containers made mostly of steel covered with a thin
      layer of tin. Cans are frequently used to package a wide range of commodities,
      particularly foods such as fruits, vegetables, soups, sauces, and more. They
      are valued for their capacity to maintain the quality and safety of the contents
      for long periods of time. The protective coating prevents the metal from reacting
      with acidic or corrosive components in the food, ensuring the product's safety.\r"
