    m_Localized: Plastic is a constructed material formed of polymers, which are
      huge molecules made up of repeated subunits. These subunits are known as monomers.
      Plastics are adaptable materials that can be molded into a variety of shapes
      and forms, making them extremely useful in a variety of applications including
      packaging such as plastic bags and containers, building materials such as pipes
      and insulation, consumer goods such as toys and electronics, medical equipment,
      automobile parts, and more.
